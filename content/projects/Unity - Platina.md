This is an experimental metroidvania game with the purpose of testing AI controlled allies/enemies and integrating Spine animation in Unity. Player can switch between two controllable characters, where the AI controlled ally will follow actions of the player. The characters and enemies are drawn in Photoshop and animated with Spine.
