Hello, I am Geyang Liu, a computer science student at the University of Victoria. My most commonly used languages are C++, C# and Python, and I'm familiar with tools including Visual Studio and Git.

My studies lean toward fields of computer graphics and data science. I'm familiar with data analysis and model training using python libraries including PyTorch and Scikit-learn, and delved into fields of computer graphics including ray tracing and procedural animation.

I've worked with various companies on fields of VR simulation and gained extensive experience with Unity, Object-Oriented-Programming and AGILE methodologies.

I'm a game developer by interest. I develop with the Unity engine, engage in my personal projects most times and occasionally participate in game jams. Besides programming, I also create 2D and 3D art assets using Photoshop, Spine and Blender.
